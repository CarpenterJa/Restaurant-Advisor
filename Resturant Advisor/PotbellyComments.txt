I live right above this Potbelly and think it's awesome. The people who work there are always SUPER friendly and always make sure you know what you're getting. I've never actually sat in there and ate before, but it seems very clean and kept up. It's also never too busy at night or weekends so it's a quick and easy trip!

Solid but still a little overpriced for what you get to eat. I remember them from AZ, which I felt was a better sandwich. Not bad, not great.

I love this location! Although it is quite busy, the staff here is so awesome! Always so friendly and upbeat. My order is always made right and despite the long line, the wait usually isn't too bad.
