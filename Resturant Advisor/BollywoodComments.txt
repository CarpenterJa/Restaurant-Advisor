I have dined at my share of Indian restaurants throughout the world, I can honestly say that none can compare to the service and amazing flavors and freshness that Bollywood has to offer! I cannot say enough about this restaurant and the individuals who work there, I love every experience I have a Bollywood. You will not be sorry when you try this Indian restaurant

Been there for dinner on the weekend. Also for their lunch buffet. I'm not well versed on the names of everything I ate, but i can tell you that both experiences were very good. It's not cheap, but not super expensive either. I highly recommend it for dinner or lunch. Enjoy!

This place is amazing. The staff is awesome and the food is some of the best in Milwaukee. You won't be disappointed!
