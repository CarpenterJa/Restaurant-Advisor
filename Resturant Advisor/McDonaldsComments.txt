It's McDonalds .... food is always the same wherever you go. 

Every time I go here to get my son a happy meal, the food is always cold. Not to mention the wait. Not only that but they always ask if it's for a boy or girl and he always ends up with girl toys or no toy at all. Frustrated.....

I am never ordering coffee here again! Ordered an ice coffee here last week and couldn't even taste the coffee. 100% creamer. And then a friend of mine told me the same thing happened to her today.
