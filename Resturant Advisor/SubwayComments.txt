Around 830pm Friday the September 14th I when in to get a sandwich and the staff was already putting away everything and made me feel like it's was an inconvenience for them to make me a sandwich even when the door stated they closed at 9pm. The employees were on their phones and trying to ignore all the customers very unprofessional and very poorly made sandwich

Great service and great subs!!!! And I like how it is also a cafe style shop so they have very comfy booths and stool chairs!!!
