Who puts cheese on before lettuce? And then wraps a burrito the wrong way? more importantly, How can you be bad at wrapping burritos when that is your only job in the assembly line? Go here to find out.

This place isn't bad to eat at. There are many options but definitely not as good as Chipotle. They also are very stingy about the amount of meat and toppings they give you.
