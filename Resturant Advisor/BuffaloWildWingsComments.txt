Always a great time! The hiring manager does a great job at choosing servers because I've never had a bad one. And they are great about IDing I have had to go out to my car several times to get my ID. Food is always hot and quick!

As far as bdubs goes, this one is pretty bad. The food is similar to other locations but I have never had good service at this location.

Some of the worst and slowest service in downtown Milwaukee.. in fact I can't believe they are still open. Everytime I have been here the staff is so rude and they act like they're so busy even though there is hardly anyone in the building (maybe 2 tables at max). I've never had a pleasant experience here and the food takes awhile to come out too. I love bdubs but not this location!
