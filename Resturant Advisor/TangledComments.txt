Such an excellent restaurant, best place for soup and noodles on campus! Lunch buffet is cheap and reliable, most things are great as leftovers, service is fast, and the space is open and bright.

This review is only about the lunch buffet.  The service was good and the decor is clean but the food is ... meh.  Meat was over-cooked; noodles had a different texture.  For the money, the selection is limited.  It seems the menu is geared toward students and cheap eats.  Fine.  Probably will not return.

Taiwanese beef noodles were amazing!!! Definitely would recommend. The lunch buffet was small and not really worth in my opinion. I would order off the menu over the lunch buffet!
