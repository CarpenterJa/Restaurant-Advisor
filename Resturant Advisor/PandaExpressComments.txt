Horrible! Most items were not available and what was left clearly had been there a while. Couldn't even eat what I ordered. Save your money and go somewhere else.

Solid panda express food. Service is accommodating, counter was clean, and orders have always been right which is the biggest part for a food court. Sadly there isn't a full dine in panda express location close by.

Never was there before. My friend who was with me suggest the place. The broccoli and beef with noodles , 2 egg rolls and compo chicken.  We shared 1 plate. The staff was very helpful and friendly answered my questions about what they would recommend. My friend and I enjoyed the dinner. Yes highly recommend the food. They have chop sticks which was a plus for me.
