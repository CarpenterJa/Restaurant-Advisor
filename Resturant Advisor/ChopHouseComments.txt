This was an awesome experience. The food quality and quantity were excellent. Service was beyond excellent. Probably in the top 3 best steaks I have had. The sides were equally as good. We would definitely eat there again. Love the old style feel of the place. Totally expected to see Sinatra walk through the door.

"Medium rare" steak was served rare, and more so, was flavorless.  You'd think a well rated steak joint could manage to cook a steak. Nope. Asparagus was the only decent thing served.  Lame chain. Next. Servers were nice though.
