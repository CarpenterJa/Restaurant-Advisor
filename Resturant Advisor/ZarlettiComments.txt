Being right around the corner from my place of work, Zarletti's makes a great location to take business clients and meetings to.  I have been there for both lunch and dinner meetings and am always met with extraordinary service and food.  I have never had a disappointing experience with Zarletti's.

I've had some great dishes at Zarletti and some misses as well, I think your experience really depends on how you order.  Their ravioli is pretty bland but I really enjoyed Pasta al Pomodoro.  Highly recommend the burrata appetizer but you can pass on the bruschetta.  I found it to be a bit overpriced based on the quality but one of the better Italian places in Milwaukee.

Food is always outstanding as is the service. Love the pistachio encrusted sea bass but you can't go wrong with anything you order. I have eaten here dozens of times. One of my favorite restaurants in all of Milwaukee.
